// Question 1: Sorting and Searching (CLO: 1)
// 5 points Shaheen Real Estate Agency is one of the authorized dealers of New-Malir housing society. The society contains multiple blocks of houses. Each block contains N houses of equal in size. Shaheen agency got the license to sale the houses of only I block of the society. Luckily all the houses are sold to the N no of different families in a week. Initially at the booking, they were randomly allocating the house from 1 to N. But according to the rules of society, every family allotted a house must have a neighboring family with less no of family members to its left.
// You need to design an algorithm to solve the issue and re-shuffle them according to the rule of the society.
